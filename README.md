# Extractive Text summarization

Code used for my master thesis, It explores 4 difference methods of extractive text summarization in 2 different datasets. The code + commentaries are in the 4 notebooks.

This code uses 2 datasets:
- Dataset 1: https://www.kaggle.com/sunnysai12345/news-summary
- Dataset 2: https://cs.nyu.edu/~kcho/DMQA/ under CNN stories dataset

The methods explored are:
1. Word frequency
2. TextRank
3. LSA
4. [Presumm](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm)

There are 4 different notebooks:
- NombreNotebook1: Methods 1-3 for dataset 1
- NombreNotebook2: Methods 1-3 for dataset 2
- NombreNotebook3: Method 4 for dataset 1
- NombreNotebook4: Method 4 for dataset 2

The results are evaluated Using the F1-Score of ROUGUE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L

For more details about the code see each specific notebook
